# gmx_scripts(Gromacs)
Simple scripts for automating some steps of Justin A. Lemkul's tutorial for Gromacs. Useful mainly for simulations with large series of ligands.

-> Topology Ligands

          python3 fix.py 
          
- Searches for '.mol2' files and run the script 'sort_mol2_bonds.pl' generating the '_fix.mol2'.

          python3 pos_cgenff.py

- Use after generating '.str' on CGenff site - Script searches for '_fix.mol2' and '.str' runs the 'cgenff_charmm2gmx_py3.py' script to generate the '_ini.pdb' used in the sequence by 'editconf' to generate '.gro

-> LigPreparationGMX

- The three steps above in only one.
- Automates the preparation of ligand. Download script sort_mol2_bonds.pl and cgenff_charmm2gmx.py for use this.
- Putting the script in the directory with ligands in .mol2.
- It perform the script sort_mol2_bonds.pl obtain fix.mol2 obtain the .str file from CGenFF website runs the script cgenff_charmm2gmx and generates the .gro file by editconf.
- Finally creates directories for the results of each ligand.


-> Topology Complex 

Complex.py - The script merge prot.gro with lig.gro (or lig and cof) keeps the box_vector of prot and changes the total number of molecules at the beginning of the file.

          python3 complex.py prot.gro lig.gro

          python3 complex.py prot.gro lig.gro cof.gro

remove_SOL.py - For gas-phase simulations, input solv_ions.gro and the script remove SOL from the file, change the final number of molecules and return prot_ions.gro.


-> Topols

          python3 topol_<>.py lig cof
          (do not put extension)

Depending on topol_ it includes ligand parameters , ligand topology and molecules at the end of the file or position restraints 

-> Complex + Topol

This script must be run in the directory under analysis. It creates the complex.gro file and makes adjustments to topol.top. Used for protein and ligand or protein ligand and cofactor

          python3.9 complex.py prot_name lig_name lig_name cof_name

Extensions MUST be added.

-> Analises_gmx

          python3 analises_gmx.py <sv_all or sv_trj or gp_trj>

Obtains only the "center" and/or "fit" trajectory for solvent or gas-phase complexes (pcouple = no, only nvt equilibrium) with sv_trj and gp_trj or sv_all = RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Gyrate.

Changing the name of the .tpr in "cmd"
